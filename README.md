# dl_attachments
CLI script to conditionally download and print attachment files from email inboxes, invoked as `dla`. Printing is handled using `lpr`.
Currently only prints `.pdf` files.

Handy for dealing with large amounts of daily orders, labels, or other printable documents sent via email.

Can be easily run as a cronjob.

## Setup ðŸ”§
Clone the repo and change to directory:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/dch42/dl_attachments.git && cd dl_attachments
~~~

Add exec permissions and run `setup.sh`:
~~~
chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
~~~
This will install dependencies and install the script as `dla` in /Users/$USER/bin, as well as add to bash or zsh $PATH.

### Config

Fill out the configuration file: `config.yml`.

Printer information can be found via CUPS web admin interface, or with `lpstat -p -d`.
